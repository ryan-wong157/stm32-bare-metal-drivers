# stm32-bare-metal-drivers
A collection of bare metal peripheral drivers for the stm32f446re Nucleo. The goal is to write hardware abstraction layer functions, similar to the STM32 HAL, for various peripherals like GPIO, UART, I2C, CAN, Timers. This is a simple upskilling project to become more familiar with microcontrollers.

## Build and Usage
As of now, I am using the STM32CubeIDE to build and flash this project. In the future, I will implement a Makefile for building and flashing.
