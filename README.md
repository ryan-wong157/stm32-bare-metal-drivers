# stm32-bare-metal-drivers
A collection of bare metal peripheral drivers for the stm32f446re Nucleo. The goal is to write hardware abstraction layer functions, similar to STM32 HAL which use various peripherals like GPIO, UART, I2C, CAN, Timers. This is a simple upskilling project to become more familiar with microcontrollers.
